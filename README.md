# MazeMeander2
This is a sequel to my first MazeMeander game. (I was a sophomore at the time and so I didn't have great coding practices when I created this game)

New features include more types of locks/keys, portals and pipes. However, the most important addition/refactor was that this game is multiplayer. Now two people can compete to find the most cheese and help each other avoid cats.
